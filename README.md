# Build an MVP With Elixir
 
I recently went through [Build an MVP With Elixir](https://pjullrich.gumroad.com/l/bmvp) by [Peter Ulrich](https://peterullrich.com) as whirlwind tour of using Elixir with the Phoenix framework.

This repository is the resulting code. As I was just getting a feel for the language/framework I did not tie into all of the could dependencies discussed in the tutorial.
